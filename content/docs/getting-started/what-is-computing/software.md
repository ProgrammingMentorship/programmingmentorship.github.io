# Software

Software is the easiest part of a computing system to adjust and tinker with. Unlike hardware and processors which are expensive to change (you have to get a job at Intel,) or massive computer networks, you can write a few lines of code and change the behaviour of your computer in moments at the software level. This is where (for us, today,) the magic happens.
