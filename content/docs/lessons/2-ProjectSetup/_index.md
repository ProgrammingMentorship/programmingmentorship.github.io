# Project Setup: Introduction

{{< hint warning >}}
**Warning: Work in Progress**  
We are still working to improve this page before releasing it to
students. It may change considerably before first release.  If you can
see this message, congrats, you have been introduced to this material
early to provide feedback!

submit changes for consideration.

It is now time for use to move to a desktop environment and and get you setup
with a more efficient programming environment. And the Clojure language!

Before now we have been evaluating code in the browser using a language called
_scheme_ to introduce you to the basics of a programming language. We would have
liked to have you introduced to Clojure right away but we did not find an easy
way to do that in the browser.

In this section we will cover...
1. What a **project template** is
2. How it is **run**
3. How to use a **code library** and **namespaces**
4. The procedure to **compile** it
5. How to use the **REPL**

If we lived in an ideal world we would save this entire section for another
course, and keep you evaluating code in the browser. However we would be too
limited in what we are able to do. You will learn faster once we get you setup
and running with what is called the **REPL** but more on that later.

Note our focus for this course is on _how to use the tools_ rather than _how the
tools work_. There is a higher class of developers that actually design the
programming languages & compilers that we use to build our programs with. This
is like the difference between being a carpenter versus the manufacturer of the
screwdriver or hammer. These are different disciplines with some overlapping
skills.

For example, many programmers spend their entire careers without understanding
how a **compiler** actually works. You can go a long way with just understanding
_how to use_ the tools we will talk about in the rest of this section. 

> This again comes back to the fundamental concept of **abstraction**. If an
**abstration** is done well we don't need to worry about it.

## Cool Things to Note
1. With REPL we are getting you started with a fully functional testing environment right
   away. Typically this is restricted until you take an entire course on
   testbenches and test driven development. Many times this is a specific role
   on the development team.
2. With the **Project Template** and our development setup you are using
   cutting-edge industry level tools. All of the structures we are learning
   about here are used to build large industry applications from companies like
   Walmart and Netflix. Typically Project templates are not covered in an intro
   to programming course.
3. You are at the cutting edge of progress. The next set of tools we will be
   adding were only created within the last few years.
