# Project Setup: Lesson 3: Libraries & Namespaces

{{< hint warning >}}
**Warning: Work in Progress**  
We are still working to improve this page before releasing it to
students. It may change considerably before first release.  
{{< /hint >}}



## Namespaces
Explain what a namespace is

Explain dot notation and what it means with the slashes etc.
    i.e. (jaxank.ExtensionLibs.JaxExtension/maplet ...)




## Internal Libraries
These are essentially just the files in your project, but they are not really different than a full library that is external.

Should be thinking about everything in your project as functions and how to use
them later. So not a horrible idea to literally refer to them as libraries from
the get go. That or change this heading name.

## External Libraries

Introduce ideas related to getting open source libraries from other people

Link appendix on what open source is and what it means

Sites
- Clojure Toolbox
- Clojars
-...

## How to Load External Libraries
Configuration files and how to change

Notice how they are automatically downloaded

How these are typically versioned

## Deps Updater Tool
We have a deps updater tool in our template. This is so that we can update the
templates when you ask us questions.

Our template has a file in it that will let you easily update all the libraries
for a project.

When we tell you to run the bat file for updating dependencies
