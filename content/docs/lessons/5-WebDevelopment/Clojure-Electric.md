# Clojure Electric

This section is for learning Clojure Electric


The first page to pay attention to is the clojure Electric tutorials. They are a
good starting point if you know what you are doing.

the key to using Clojure Electric at a basic level of programming comes down to
how the program is designed.

There are many things you are going to want to try to do that will not work and
you will have garbage error messages that will not help you decypher the system.

At the end of the day there is a lot of complexity to the Client server
architecture and you can read about all of that in the book we have on the
Luminus system. Although not based on lumnicus the concepts of the ring handlers
and the basics of the architecture are used in Electric as well.

## So I am thinking topics will be

- Client server architecture basics
- Clojure common and reader conditionals
- Specifics to our template
- Running the main program with local host
- Making a small change
- Styling with TailWind
- Concept of SPA
- Concept of responsive web apps
- ...

## Project 1: Producing a Basic Static-like Site 
where we are not doing forms or anything with this project, just playing around
with the template

- How images are added to web pages
- Adding HTML DOM elements etc.
- Styling with TailWind

## Project 2: Do more Dynamic stuff
Options could be chatting app, or anything in the clojure electric tutorials Use
of my component library that is currently in progress... 

## Project 3: Create a reusable component
I have a design template almost done at this point that will help guide how this
should be done. Essentially how the atom is passed into the system so that you
have a reusable custom form component etc.
