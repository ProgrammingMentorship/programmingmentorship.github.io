# Clojure Electric Introduction


The first page to pay attention to is the clojure Electric tutorials. They are a
good starting point if you know what you are doing.

the key to using Clojure Electric at a basic level of programming comes down to
how the program is designed.

There are many things you are going to want to try to do that will not work and
you will have garbage error messages that will not help you decypher the system.

At the end of the day there is a lot of complexity to the Client server
architecture and you can read about all of that in the book we have on the
Luminus system. Although not based on lumnicus the concepts of the ring handlers
and the basics of the architecture are used in Electric as well.

# What is Clojure Electric
This is an interesting section to write because in many respects I really don't
have to explain what this system is other than to describe that it is a system
that allows us to combine our client and server code into a single page. Where
traditionally this would be either impossible or challanging, I can very easily
swap between client and server code by calling functions e/client and e/server.




# For the Advanced people...
Clojure Electric is a cool new cutting-edge system that allows us to combine the
client and server architecture of a web application into a single section of
code. It provides a comprehensive set of systems that allow us to quickly
develop a web application without having to worry about any of the data
endpoints or routing between the Client and Server.

It automatically sets up a websocket connection and enables bidirectional
communication between the client and server.
