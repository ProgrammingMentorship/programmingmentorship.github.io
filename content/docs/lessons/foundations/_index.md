# Foundations: Introduction

This course is a work in progress, and the content is subject to change.

There are two schools of thought regarding computer science. When
programs or the problems they solve grow too large, we can choose to
teach people one of the two following solutions:

1. **Systems to discipline their work** so they can collaborate in
   massive teams to deliver commercial projects.
2. **Powerful and flexible ways of thinking** so they can be
   productive enough to solve the problem alone or in a far smaller
   team.

We aim to teach the **second method** - to introduce in a thoughtful and
fun way these more powerful foundational concepts early.
The introduction of 
[Simply Scheme](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ssch0/preface.html) 
has further explanation if you'd like to better understand our
approach.

Teaching this way means starting a bit further back in theory than
most programming mentorship groups, but we can attest that building a
solid foundation in theory first will make you _learn faster_, _build
better_, and have you _growing far beyond your peers_ who started by
learning tools first instead of how to think about programs.

**We'll take a broad look at programming and build foundational
good habits, with a focus on understanding the two core elements of
programming:**

1. **Data**, which flows in and out of computer systems
2. **Functions**, which read and transform data
