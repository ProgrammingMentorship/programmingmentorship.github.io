# Foundations: Introduction

This course is a work in progress, and the content is subject to change.

There are two schools of thought regarding computer science. When
programs grow too large, we have two options:

1. Teach people **systems to discipline their work** so they can collaborate in
   massive teams to deliver projects.
2. Teach people **powerful and flexible ways of thinking** so they can be
   productive enough to solve the problem in a far smaller team.

We aim to teach the second method - to introduce in a thoughtful and
fun way these more powerful foundational concepts early.
The introduction of 
[Simply Scheme](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ssch0/preface.html) 
has further explanation if you'd like to better understand our
approach.

This means starting a bit further back in theory than most programming
mentorship groups, but we can attest that building a solid foundation
in theory first will make you _learn faster_, _build better_, and have
you _growing far beyond your peers_ who started by learning tools
first instead of how to think about programs.

**We'll take a broad look at programming and build foundational
good habits, with a focus on understanding the two core elements of
programming:**

1. **Data**, which flows in and out of computer systems
2. **Functions**, which read and transform data
